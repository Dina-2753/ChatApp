Real-Time Chat Application

A Real-Time Chat Application built using Node.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB for seamless communication between users. The application allows users to join chat rooms, send messages, and receive real-time updates across multiple rooms. The backend is powered by Express.js and MongoDB for storing user data, while Socket.io ensures real-time, bi-directional communication between the server and clients.


Technologies Used:

Backend:
    Node.js with Express.js for building the server-side application.
    Socket.io for real-time WebSocket communication.
    MongoDB and Mongoose for database management and validation.

Frontend:
   React.js (or any frontend framework) for the client-side interface.
   Socket.io-client for real-time messaging with the server.

Environment Management:
   dotenv for loading environment variables.
